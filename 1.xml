Wikipedia: Anarchism http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism Anarchism is a political 
philosophy that advocates stateless societies based on non-hierarchical free 
associations."That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, 
when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to 
impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organization and preaches free agreement ¡ª at 
the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without 
which no human or animal society can exist. Etymology and
